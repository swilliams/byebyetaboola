Bye Bye Taboola 
=========

Get rid of those awful Taboola ads. In general I'm fine with ads on the Internet. People gotta make money somehow, so I don't run an adblocker. Taboola, however, goes beyond the pale in terms of shady, slimy ads that masquerade as links to content, when in reality it's just clickbait that doesn't go anywhere worthwhile. I'm tired of seeing them over and over again on otherwise decent websites, so this just removes them from the site altogether.
